# Practice Session #2: Reading & Working with Data

## Goal

Read a data file into R, and create a script to capture some basic data review.  Don't forget to create an RStudio project to organize your work!

## Exercise

1. Create a new RStudio project.
2. Download the [example data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2021-r-shortcourse/main/data/Choi2017_DDA_Skyline_annotation.csv) and place it inside your project.
3. Create a new R script in your project and write code to read the data file into R.
4. Perform some basic data review on the data:
   * How many rows does the table have?
   * Extract the `Condition` variable (column) from the data table.
   * Subset (index) the data table to rows with `BioReplicate` values greater than 2.
5. Be sure to save all your code in your R script and practice executing each line of code in the console.
6. Close RStudio, and reopen your project.  Confirm your script is present and that your code was properly saved.
