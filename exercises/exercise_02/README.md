# Practice Session #2: Reading & Working with Data

## Goal

Read a data file into R, and create a script to capture some basic data review.  Don't forget to create an RStudio project to organize your work!

## Exercise

1. Create a new RStudio project.
2. Download the [example data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2021-r-shortcourse/main/exercises/tidy_data_dplyr/data/example_data.csv) and place it inside your project.
3. Create a new R script in your project and write code to read the data file into R.
4. Perform some basic data review on the data:
   * How many rows does the table have?
   * Extract the `ms_instr` variable (column) from the data table.
   * Subset (index) the data table to rows with `MCL_001` values greater than 100.
5. Be sure to save all your code in your R script and practice executing each line of code in the console.
6. Close RStudio, and reopen your project.  Confirm your script is present and that your code was properly saved.
7. Repeat the above steps, but this time using the [Excel version of the data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2021-r-shortcourse/main/exercises/tidy_data_dplyr/data/example_data.xlsx).
