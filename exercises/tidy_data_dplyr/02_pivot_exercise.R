# Exercise: pivotting data
#

# Input data summary
#
# MS data were collected on 10 samples.
# These samples were measured on two different
# MS instruments with 3 replicates each.  
# Each MS run quantified 100 different analytes.
#
# Summary:
# 10 samples
# 2 MS instruments
# 3 replicate measurements
# 100 measured analytes
#


# Step 0: Load the tidyverse package





# Step #1: Read in the data file: data/example_data.csv





# Step #2: Review the input data
# What are the observations (rows)?
# What are the variables (columns)?
# Is this data in wide or long format?
# How many rows does it have?
# Do the number of rows match what you'd expect from the summary above?
#   Hint -- how many samples, instrument, and replicates are there
# How many columns does it have?
# Do the number of columns match what you'd expect from the summary above?
#  Hint -- how many analytes are there? why do we have more columns than that?





# Step #3: Pivot the data from wide to long format
# What's the name of the function we should use?
#   Hint -- look at the examples in tidy_data_example.R 





# Step #4: Review the results
# How many rows are in the long format data?
# Do the number of rows match your expectation?
#   Hint - how many MS runs total are there? how many analytes are there?
