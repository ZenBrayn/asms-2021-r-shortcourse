### this exercise section will incorporate most of the things we have seen to in this course using an example weather dataset

#### Exercise 0: Read in the dataset .csv
# this csv contains climate data for Denver, Colorado between 2016-2019
# examine the structure of the data.frame to learn about variable names


#### Exercise 1: Find the month and year with the highest snowfall


#### Exercise 2: Find months where there was no snowfall


#### Exercise 3: Find average precipitation per year
# we have 2016,2017,2018,2019
# another handy function for this is unique()


# the tidyverse makes this sort of operation extremely easy and possible in 2 lines of code...

#### Exercise 4: Convert temperatures to Celcius and add new columns with these to data.frame
# F to C conversion -> (F - 32) * (5/9)
# order of operations is important!


#### Exercise 5: Find the month with the greatest difference between max and min temperature


#### Exercise 6: write updated .csv of the data.frame with C data
